# handtracking

This code uses the MediaPipe library to detect hands in a video stream. The code begins by importing the necessary libraries, cv2 for working with videos and images, and mediapipe for using the hand detection model. The code then creates an instance of the Hands class, which is a part of the mp.solutions.hands module. This instance will be used to process the video frames and detect hands in them.

The code then captures video from the default camera using the cv2.VideoCapture() function. The code enters a while loop where it continuously reads frames from the video stream, and converts each frame from BGR color space to RGB color space using cv2.cvtColor(). The converted image is then passed to the Hands.process() method to detect hands.

The Hands.process() method returns an object containing the detection results, including the coordinates of the hand landmarks. If the object contains any hand landmarks, the code then uses the mpDraw.draw_landmarks() function to draw the hand landmarks on the image. The function takes the image, the hand landmarks and the connections between the landmarks as input. Then the code displays the image with the hand landmarks using cv2.imshow(). The cv2.waitKey(1) is used to wait for a key press before proceeding to the next frame.
